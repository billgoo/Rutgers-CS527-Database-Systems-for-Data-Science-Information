1- Import the attached file (Challenger.csv) to your RDB or Redshift.

2- Create a stored procedure call KNN with five inputs (@table, @target, @predictor, @value, @k).
Example:
@table = 'Challenger'
@target = 'O-Ring failure'
@predictor = 'Launch temperature'
@value = 30
@k = 1  

@k can be any number between 1 to 5,

3- Find @k nearest neighbors to @value by measuring its distance to values in @predictor column.

4- Return the majority class (N or Y) of @target or the proportion of N and Y.
